# Rainfall-vs-Crop-Yield-Analyzer
🎯 Project Goal:
To understand how rainfall affects crop production using data and graphs.

🧰 Tools Used:
Pandas – to load and handle data

NumPy – to calculate correlation

Matplotlib – to create graphs

🔍 What the Project Does:
Loads the dataset

Shows first all rows

Gives summary (average, max, min)

Finds correlation between rainfall and crop yield

Draws:

📈 Line graph (year-wise comparison)

⚫ Scatter plot (rainfall vs yield)

Optional: Works on first 10 rows for selected operations
